# Argolis [![Build status][av-badge]][build] [![NuGet version][nuget-badge]][nuget-link] [![codecov.io][cov-badge]][cov-link] [![codefactor][codefactor-badge]][codefactor-link]

[Hydra hypermedia controls][hydra] for .NET Web applications written in [Nancy][nancy].

## Introduction

### Hydra

From Hydra homepage

> Hydra simplifies the development of interoperable, hypermedia-driven Web APIs

Hydra does it by defining (*still in production though*) a wide variety of hypermedia controls, which allow the implementation
of resilient API clients. This resilience is achieved by relying on runtime API documentation and not out-of-band information
and human-readable API descriptions.

For more information please see it's [specification page](http://www.hydra-cg.com/spec/latest/core/).

### Argolis

Argolis is a [Super-Duper-Happy-Path][sdhp] towards documenting .NET web applications with Hydra. It struggles to be as simple as
possible and have the least impact on your actual application logic:

* Provides out-of-the-box defaults and conventions
* Any default behaviour can be modified (thank you [Strategy Pattern][sp])
* Doesn't hijack responsibilities by using [JsonLD.Entities][JsonLD.Entities] and [Nancy.Rdf][Nancy.Rdf] packages

#### The name

The name Argolis comes from the [ancient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_ancient_Greece#Argolis) (and 
[modern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argolis)) Greek province sometimes called *The Argolid*. Argolis is where the mythological
monster [Hydra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lernaean_Hydra) lived. The monster's full name is Lernaean Hydra after the lake
of Lerna, where it had it's lair.

## Getting started with Argolis

*TL;DR;* To install add the Nuget package.

```
PM> Install-Package Argolis.Nancy
```

It is a meta-package, which pulls all components from their respective NuGet packages.

Currently only Nancy is supported, but the core library doesn't have a dependency and Web API
or ServiceStack are definitely a possibility.

### Basic usage

There are three steps requried to start using Agolis(.Nancy)

#### Implement `IHydraDocumentationSettings`

... and [wire it up with Nancy][Registrations].

``` c#
public class HydraDocumentationSettings : IHydraDocumentationSettings
{
    public string DocumentationPath
    {
        get { return "api"; }
    }

    public IriRef EntryPoint
    {
        get { return (IriRef)"http://localhost:61186/entrypoint"; }
    }
}

public class ArgolisRegistrations : Registrations
{
    public ArgolisRegistrations(ITypeCatalog tc) : base(tc)
    {
        Register<IHydraDocumentationSettings>(new HydraDocumentationSettings());
    }
}
```

This will set up the [`hydra:entryPoint`](http://www.hydra-cg.com/spec/latest/core/#hydra:entrypoint) link and the 
route used to serve API Documentation.

#### Implement `IDocumentedTypeSelector`

This interface is used to discover `Type`s, which should be used to produce [SupportedClasses][sc] exposed by the API.
There is an abstract class `AssemblyAnnotatedTypeSelector`, which will look for types annotated with `[SupportedClass]`
in given assemblies.

``` c#
public class AssembliesToScanForSupportedTypes : AssemblyAnnotatedTypeSelector
{
    protected override IEnumerable<Assembly> Assemblies
    {
        get { yield return typeof (Issue).Assembly; }
    }
}
```

#### Define your models

``` c#
[SupportedClass("http://example.api/o#Issue")]
[Description("An issue reported by our users")]
public class Issue
{
    public string Id { get; set; }
        
    [JsonProperty("titel")]
    public string Title { get; set; }
        
    public string Content { get; set; }
        
    [Description("The number of people who liked this issue")]
    public int LikesCount { get; private set; }

    public bool IsResolved { get; set; }

    public User Submitter { get; set; }

    [Range("http://example.api/o#project")]
    public string ProjectId { get; set; }
    
    private JObject Context => new AutoContext<Issue>();
}
```

Mandatory parts are the `[SupportedClass]` attribute and a `@context`. Here it is defined directly in the class
but it can also be provided by implementing `IContextProvider` and registering it with the container.

Please see the documentation of [JsonLd.Entities](https://github.com/wikibus/JsonLD.Entities/tree/master/src/Documentation/ResolvingContext)
for more details of how the JSON-LD context can be created.

#### Serve your ApiDocumentation

Requesting the configured route will return the `hydra:ApiDocumentation` (excerpt).

``` bash
curl http://localhost:61186/api -H Accept:application/ld+json
```

``` json
{
  "@context": {
	// ...
  },
  "@id": "http://localhost:61186/api",
  "@type": "ApiDocumentation",
  "entrypoint": "http://localhost:61186/entrypoint",
  "supportedClass": [
    {
      "@id": "http://example.api/o#Issue",
      "@type": "Class",
      "description": "An issue reported by our users",
      "supportedProperty": [
        {
          "@type": "SupportedProperty",
          "description": "The title property",
          "property": {
            "@id": "http://example.api/o#Issue/titel",
            "@type": "rdf:Property",
            "range": "xsd:string"
          },
          "readable": true,
          "required": false,
          "title": "title",
          "writeable": true
        },
        {
          "@type": "SupportedProperty",
          "description": "The number of people who liked this issue",
          "property": {
            "@id": "http://example.api/o#Issue/likesCount",
            "@type": "rdf:Property",
            "range": "xsd:int"
          },
          "readable": true,
          "required": false,
          "title": "likesCount",
          "writeable": false
        },
        {
          "@type": "SupportedProperty",
          "description": "The dateCreated property",
          "property": {
            "@id": "http://example.api/o#Issue/dateCreated",
            "@type": "rdf:Property",
            "range": "xsd:dateTime"
          },
          "readable": true,
          "required": false,
          "title": "dateCreated",
          "writeable": false
        }
      ],
      "title": "Issue"
    }    
  ]
}
```

## Building

### On Windows

To manage packages, Argolis uses [Paket](). To restore them, either install the [VS
extension]() or run Cake from PowerShell command line:

```
.\build.ps1 -Target Restore
```

### On Mac (And Linux, presumably)

Argolis develops perfectly fine on Mac using `dotnet` and JetBrains Rider. However,
the Cake script runner is PowerShell, which may or may not work great. 

To restore packages install `Paket` from homebrew and run the native binary:

```
brew install paket
paket restore
```

## Releasing

Before publishing a release, make sure to update the changelog. First, install
`standard-changelog`:

```
npm i -g standard-changelog
```

And then use it to update the changelog, commit and tag

```
standard-changelog
git add CHANGELOG.md
git ci -m"vX.Z.Y"
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push --tags
```
